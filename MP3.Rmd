If you googled [*‘movies playing near me’*](https://www.google.com/search?q=movies+playing+near+me&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS769US769&oq=movies+playing+near+me&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2614j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), chances are that you will find that a good number of the results are remakes or sequels.

Humankind wants to find out how the story ends but we also want to know what comes after the ending. That is why cliffhangers exist, because Hollywood knows the audience always wants more. 

So it should not surprise you to find several remakes and sequels of your favorite movies - or any movie really.

Take for example the Star Wars franchise. There are currently 10 Star Wars movies with The [Last Jedi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527336/) coming out on December 15th of this year and [Star Wars Episode IX](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2527338/) scheduled to release in December, 2019.

How often are remakes or sequels made? Is Hollywood more repetitive than it’s ever been? Follow us to find out whether or not the trend of sequels is new to the cinematic world. 

To demystify this new (or as you will later learn - not so new) trend we looked at data from imdb to find out the average time (in years) between the production of an original and it’s sequels. 

We wanted to study if the trend of sequels and remakes truly are the new fad in cinema, or if it has existed since the beginning of film industry.

We wanted to see if this trend was similar across popular genres like Action, Horror, Thriller, Romance, etc. What we found was that trends in sequels, remakes and spin-offs vary across movie genres.

With the universes of [DC](http://www.dccomics.com/) and [Marvel](http://marvel.com/universe/Main_Page#axzz50zC0gmhF) comics, it should come to no surprise that the genre with the most sequels and remakes is Action[^1].

Apart from a few exceptions, Romance movies have barely taken part in the sequel trend (insert another interesting footnote about romance films)[^2]. This is also true for Thrillers and Family movies.

On a general scale however, Hollywood has always been repetitive, and it’s not just hollywood. Any form of storytelling has always made use of repetition, retelling the story to keep it interesting for a new audience and so, alive for a long time.

Homer’s Odyssey is in part a sequel to Iliad. After oral poetry and storytelling, books are the oldest and most popular medium of entertainment. Some of the best sellers in the late Victorian Era such as Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Gulliver’s Travels (1726) brought huge revenue to the publishers(Den of Geek).

As a result of this huge economic gain, the publishers produced sequels like Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput (1727) and The New Gulliver (1730). This trend still exists in present day in TV Shows, books, and movies. 

# **Has Hollywood started reproducing films faster?**

```{r}
#Filter for only sequels (link_type_id = 1)

sequels <- repetitions%>%
  filter(link_type_id == 1)
```

```{r}
#Adding the production_year of prequel

sql2 <- "SELECT id, title, production_year as prequel_release_year
FROM title
WHERE kind_id = 1 
Group by id
;"

prequel_release <- db%>%
  dbGetQuery(sql2)
```

```{r}
#Join sequels tbl and prequel_release tbl

movies <- sequels %>%
  #join so that the sequels are linked to their prequels
  inner_join(prequel_release, by = c("linked_movie_id" = "id")) %>%
  #rename columns to make tbl easier to read
  rename(title = title.x, prequel_title = title.y) %>%
  #find the time between orginal and sequels for each movie
  mutate(time_between_sequels = production_year - prequel_release_year)

#omit NA values 
movies <- na.omit(movies)

movies <- movies %>%
  filter(time_between_sequels <= 10)

#Find the average time between originals and their sequels by year
diff_prod <- movies %>%
  group_by(prequel_release_year)%>%
   filter(genre %in% c("Comedy", "Romance", "Action", "Thriller","Horror", "Animation", "Family")) %>%
  mutate(avg_difference = mean(time_between_sequels))
```

```{r}
#create ggplot
ggplot(diff_prod, aes(x = prequel_release_year, y = avg_difference))+
  #add a title
  ggtitle("Difference in Production Years Between Sequels
                    and Original Movies")+
  geom_point(col = "#F6B54A", size = 0.7)+
  #create a line to see a general trend
  geom_smooth()+
  #geom_smooth(col = "#0F75EA", size = 0.4, linetype = 1)+
  scale_x_continuous("Production Year (Original Film)",
                     breaks = seq(0,2020,20))+
  scale_y_continuous("Difference 
in Production Years")+
  theme(title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7))
```

In the graph above, the trend seems to show that sequels are being produced at a much faster rate than they were before. The average difference between the the production year of the sequels and its orignal has become smaller as we enter the 21st century. So eventhough Hollywood has always been repetitive, in more recent years it's repetitiveness is becoming more apparent than is actually was. 

The first film, or show is the riskiest and most expensive. The makers have to invest a huge amount of money in advertising, building the story plot, costumes, etc. After the success of the original, there is a target population, set theme and story, and more budget to produce the sequels (https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiesola/2016/02/25/want-to-produce-a-profitable-movie-make-a-sequel/#59928917472e). As a result, sequels are relatively low risk and easier for the film makers or publishers to get behind. 

Moreover we need to keep in mind that the US is NOT the only target audience for Hollywood. North America contributes to only 1/3 of Hollywood’s total income (http://www.economist.com/node/18178291). The rest of world including many Asian and African countries also add to Hollywood’s revenue. The remakes might be boring and repetitive to the American audience, but they are fresh and new to the 2/3 of Hollywood’s income generators (http://www.economist.com/node/18178291) [^3]. Therefore, Hollywood might not stop cashing in on the success of the originals right away!
